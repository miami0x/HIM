## Abstract

HIM is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) trading agent designed to redefine automated trading and liquidity management. Built on the ElizaOS framework, HIM leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize liquidity pool participation, yield farming, and market strategies. HIM operates exclusively on Solana for now, taking advantage of its speed, low transaction costs, and vibrant DeFi ecosystem. The project features an autonomous DeFi trading agent that focuses on revenue-generating strategies, sharing profits from trades directly with ETHOS token holders, fostering community-driven growth and participation. Governed by Ethos DAO, development and growth are community-driven. Post-launch, the agent will integrate advanced machine learning models to enhance trading intelligence and predictive capabilities. The project is powered by $ETHOS, the native governance token of Ethos DAO, which aligns incentives, funds the projectâ€™s treasury, and empowers community governance. Additionally, Ethos DAO has ambitious plans to develop a standalone trading terminal platform, which will provide robust tools and insights to traders, further solidifying HIMâ€™s impact in the DeFi ecosystem. The agent's trading capabilities will go live following the launch of ETHOS DAO, ensuring seamless integration and operational readiness.
